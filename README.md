Simple Miles to Kilometers Converter

This project using Tkinter to create a GUI. I used the grid system to place the different parts of the converter. The converter takes the miles a user inputs, then when the button is clicked that number is multiplied by the difference between miles and kilometers to calculate the kilometers.
